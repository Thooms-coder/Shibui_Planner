    "15% | Endpoint completeness - There should be good logical flow between pages in your application.  When a user makes a selection they should not be delivered to dead links or dead ends even if the selection they made is not within the typical use case.15% | Business logic - Business logic must be enforced on all forms.  Users should not be able to break the database integrity by entering invalid data.\n",
    "20% | Documentation - A markdown file is provided in the Github repo showing all required information including user types, user credentials (for demonstration purposes), relational diagram, use cases and at least 3 custom SQL view queries.\n",
    "10% | Style - Pages in your application should be reasonably presentable.  They do not need to be highly styled but they should clearly communicate information to the user.  Field names in forms, non-serifed font and line breaks where necessary are all important.\n",
